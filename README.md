## **Vit_Classifier_CIFAR10**<br>
It is an example of recognizing images by training the Artificial intelligence on CIFAR 10 data set.<br>
It is using Machine learning to recognise the picture and train itself so that it can responde.
It is using the following libraries:
* Tensorflow : It is used to recognise the images given by the user to recognise. TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google.
* Keras : It is used for training the Machine learning model and to generate the neural network for the image recognization. Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow that makes it easy to build and train deep learning models.
* Numpy : It is used so that we are able use its different in built functions. NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
* Layers : A layer is a data-processing module that takes as input one or more tensors and that outputs one or more tensors.

There are many functions used in this code, some of them are like Patches,mlp,create_vit_classifier,etc.
